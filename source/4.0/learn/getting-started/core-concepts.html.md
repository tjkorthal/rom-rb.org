Before you start writing any data access code with ROM, it's a good idea to
get a high level overview of what each major component is and its overall 
purpose.

ROM fundamentally is a series of abstractions built on one another to create
a very flexible system for accessing and manipulating complex data in your
applications.

The following diagram shows an overview of the ROM architecture and provides an
outline of how data flows within a ROM based data access layer. Further down
is a basic explanation of each component.

## Data flow

### Reading Data

**Step 1:** Application Domain has a need for a particular entity/entities so it
            calls into the appropriate repository and asks for an entity
        
**Step 2.** The Repository accepts the request and combines all of the
            related associations together to create a datastore-specific query
            for the data
        
**Step 3.** Once a relation has been composed of all needed restrictions or 
            selections, the relations `#each` method is called which triggers
            the <mark>dataset</mark> to fetch the data.

**Step 4.** Raw data in the form of tuples are collected from the datastore and
            returned to the relation. Before proceeding each tuple is passed
            through an <mark>output schema</mark>.

**Step 5.** The relation, if mappers are configured, maps the tuples into an
            output entity/entities.

**Step 6.** The repository passes the entity/entities on through to the
            Application Domain.

### Writing Data

Writing data with ROM is fundamentally a process of applying commands to relations
in order to modify the stored data. 

**Step 7.** Application Domain has a need to update an entity.

**Step 8.** The repository, accepting either an entity object or a raw `Hash`
            representing the entity, configures either a changeset or direct
            command on relation to make changes to the datastore.

**Step 8.1.** Before the Changeset passes itself to the underlying command, you
              can map the Changeset data into a structure that's more akin to what
              your datastore looks like.

**Step 9.** Command processes one or more tuples through the
            <mark>input schema</mark> then executes against the datastore which
            updates the data.


## Repositories

Repositories provide a powerful CRUD interface built on top of relation,
mapping and command APIs. They give you a simple way for composing data
provided by relations, automatically mapping data to structs or custom object
types and expose simple access to commands with support for changesets.

An important function of repositories is to act as a boundary between the data
access logic and Application Domain logic. This boundary helps to reduce
the complexity of rehydrating your entities and keeps a direct dependency
on a particular datastore out of your domain.

To learn more about repositories, how to use them and their role in a system
developed using ROM, check out the
[Repositories](/%{version}/learn/repositories) section.

^INFO
  Repositories are completely optional and while they provide powerful features
  for encapsulating data access logic, they may not make sense for some 
  simple CRUD applications or one-off scripts.

## Relations

A relation is defined as a set of tuples identified by unique pairs of
attributes and their values. In ROM it is an object that responds to `#each`
which yields hashes. It is backed by a [dataset object](#datasets) provided by
the adapter.


An example of relations are tables in a SQL server. Tables can reference
other tables and sometimes all of the pieces for some "view" of the data are
spread out among two or more tables (think Multi Table Inheritance). In
situations like this ROM really shines because relations can be created for
each table and composed together to pull the data into a coherent form then
finally mapped to an output object which your application can depend on safely
without worrying about shared state, sessions or identity mapping commonly
used in other ORMs.

To learn more about relations, check out the
[Relations](/%{version}/learn/core/relations) guide.


## Commands

Commands in ROM are intended to safely modify data. Commands can be used to
create, update and delete. They are usually provided by the adapter, but you may
define your own.

To learn more about commands, check out the
[Commands](/%{version}/learn/core/commands) guide.


## Relation Mappers

A mapper is an object that takes a relation and maps it into a different
representation. Mappers are generated automatically and in typical
cases you don't have to define them; however, ROM provides a DSL to define custom
mappings or you can register your own mapper objects for custom, non-standard
queries, or complex cross-datastore mappings.

To learn more about mappers, check out the
[Mappers](/%{version}/learn/core/mappers) guide.

## Changesets

Built on-top of commands, changesets are an optional tool for making changes
in your database. The power of changesets comes from the ability to take
input data and optionally convert it into a representation that's more
compatible with your database schema before it passes into a command.

Changesets also make updating aggregate entities much easier by automatically
handling associations between multiple relations. This makes deconstructing
a complex entity and updating its individual pieces much easier.

To learn more about changesets, check out the
[Changesets](/%{version}/learn/core/changesets) guide.


## Adapters

ROM uses adapters to connect to different data sources (a database, a csv file -
it doesn't matter) and exposes a native CRUD interface to its relations. Every
adapter has extension points to support database-specific functionality. 
It provides its own relation types, extensions for built-in commands, and
potentially new command types. Furthermore, an adapter can provide extra
features that are needed to work with a given database type. For example,
`rom-sql` provides Migration API for managing the schema in a SQL database.

^
  **Remember** all of the abstractions provided by ROM are ultimately there
  to separate any hard dependencies higher up in the application stack. So
  when creating relations, take advantage of that separation by not leaking
  adapter implementation details.
^

### Gateways

An object that encapsulates access to a specific persistence backend. ROM
supports loading multiple gateways allowing an application to pull from
multiple data sources easily, including cross-datastore relations. 

Gateways are provided by the adapter and after ROM finishing loading they're
generally hidden behind the scenes.

### Datasets

Only exposed as a private interface to [Relations](#relations), datasets
act as the middle-man between relations and datastores.

For example, in the SQL adapter, datasets provide the <mark>join</mark>
functionality where columns in other tables can be joined together via
<mark>foreign_keys</mark>. This is a prime example of relations (thru datasets)
taking advantage of what the storage engine can offer while also hiding those
implementation details away from the application.
